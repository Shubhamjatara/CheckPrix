      "question": "What is a Price Comparison Website Then?",
      "answer": "A price comparison website is a website that lists all products from a number of stores at once. Think of it as a market where you get all the offers available from different sellers in one place. This takes away the hassle of moving from one online shop to another or moving from one physical shop to another in an attempt to get the best deal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is that all?",
      "answer": "No! We also have price drops which capture recent price reductions so you can find not only the best deal but at a reduced price too."
